## AI-Assisted Development

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used during the development of Fozza to:

- Improve overall code structure and refactor long methods
- Enhance exception handling logic
- Improve GUI styling and layout
- Suggest improvements to SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Principle)
- Improve JUnit test cases
- Review code quality before final submission

All AI-suggested code was reviewed, understood, and modified where necessary before committing.

AI tools were used as a productivity aid to improve development efficiency while maintaining 
full understanding of the implemented logic.
